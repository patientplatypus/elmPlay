# Leadership Principles
## Customer Obsession

**In the business of business, the customer is the business.**
- First and foremost an employee has to serve the best interests of the consumer of their deliverable whether it is a team internal to their company or an outside customer. My first thought on any engagement is 1) (in the worst case) am I doing something that will hurt my customer 2) is the plan of action going to help my customer meet their goals. As a solutions engineer I am often interfacing with sales representatives whose engineering experience is not as deep as mine.
- One of my first engagements was an ask by my manager to help a traditional, non-technical, real estate firm gather data on competitors for pricing purposes. After discussing with the sales people I realized that the promise to the customer was 1) to scrape over 700 competitor websites in ten different markets to create a pricing database and 2) there was a promise of releasing an ICO (blockchain) without a plan for monetization. I realized that this was a "red alert" as this would cost the company money in the long term and create a black mark for Oracle.
- I made sure that action was taken immediately. I informed management that we couldn't help the customer and that the sales representatives did not have the appropriate technical expertise to help the client. To do so was a large ask of myself - I had to make sure that what I said was understood to be done at the best interest of the client and the company and not as a form of self promotion.
- The end result was good! We didn't take on this client and steps were taken to make sure that the sales representative got more mentorship in a technical capacity. I later worked with that sales team on another successful blockchain project.

## Ownership
**BS is for flowers**
- I'm not a fan of "putting lipstick on a pig" - that is dressing up a failure and trying to disguise it as a good result. It's the sort of short term thinking that will work once or twice and then either it stops working or you learn to become a *BS artist*. Gross.
- What this means is that you will often become uncomfortable and sometimes have people hate you. This sucks but it's an important point of principle that matters to my integrity, *especially* as an engineer. I build things, not *pretend* to build things.
- One example occurred during my bootcamp. Me and my team stayed up for three days straight building a project that had a, let's say, *generously defined* MVP (**rut-roh**). Ultimately when we gave the presentation to other people in the camp (50+ people including other classses and outside interested parties) we had to talk about what we had accomplish. I, and my team, had to be honest. "Look guys, we tried really hard and it didn't work out - I know it sucks, but let's look at the code". That was not my proudest moment, but it mattered to me to do that. In the short term I don't think my teammates were thrilled, but I've stayed in touch with them and become good friends with some of them.

## Invent and Simplify

**MVP - that's it, just MVP**
- When working on a project I try and get to *MVP* (minimum viable product) within a confortable margin of error for the deadline of the project and leave room for error in order to iterate on that work to make it the best that we can. As a POC engineer this generally means 1) connect the pipes 2) make it pretty‚ú®.  Most of my projects follow this guideline.

## Are Right, A Lot

**Own your claims and back them up. Also, there is more than one way to skin a cat.**
**Or, how I stopped worrying and realize 'if it doesn't compile it doesn't exist'**

- My philosophy in being right, is that three things need to happen 1) you need to be right for some other purpose than to serve your own head or pocket book (*this will make the project work* is a good one) and 2) you need to be testable and 3) other right answers are also right.
- Working with other team members comes working with people of various skill levels, some who are higher and some lower than I. It also comes with working with people who are passionate about what they do. My main goal is making sure that whatever project I'm on is successful, so I try my best to work within the framework and abilities of others. Currently I'm on a project where a teammate really likes a framework that I'm not so fond of, but they can get to 2) `it compiles`. Given that there are more than one right answer, I'm treating this as a learning opportunity to work more in that framework and get some more experience in.


## Learn and Be Curious

**Chop wood, carry water**
- I like learning languages. I'm new at it, but it's becoming sort of my thing. What I've found is that for every pet project that you develop out of curiosity or for fun I will eventually find a use case for it in the future, even if it is obscure or not popular at the time.
- While on the job hunt I made `platypusTracker` a job hunting tool that scrapes indeed and the Muse and set up a calendar, email push notifications, etc. It was 'in my bedroom fun project' but I later got a call from Indeed by a recruiter because they saw it on my github. That was sort of a neat side effect of that project but not the original purpose.
- While at my bootcamp I made a phoenix/elixir app that allowed multiple users to draw on a website and share a canvas. As it turns out phoenix is good (*really good*) at socketing so it was a cool thing to learn. I later was able to leverage this knowledge to create an important demo project. Deployed on AWS it was like Reddit but real time - when a user created a comment or submitted a post it updated the view of all other users. It's the project that ended up getting me hired at Oracle.
- For SXSW I thought it would be cool to make a digital business card using Flutter, a google Dart framework cross platform for both iOs and Android. I later was able to use this at work on customer projects to quickly build prototypes.
- For this job I'm learning Elm. We'll see how I use it in the future.‚ù§Ô∏èüå≤

## Hire and Develop the Best

**Help the guy you used to be.**
- Currently Oracle is on the war path to recruit a bunch of people. I know a bunch of developers. Often, in large corporations, it can be challenging moving people through the hiring process - people can get lost in the shuffle. Miscommunications can occur. Being on the recieving end of some of these challenges I have always done my best to help other people get through the process.
- It's important to me to be the hero of my own story. If I did this work for money I would, perhaps years later, question my own motives. I don't take commission for the work of helping other people get hired here - Karma on delivery üôÉ

## Insist on the Highest Standards

**Never expect more than you would expect from yourself. Expect a lot from yourself.**
- One of the things that I've found at work that I can improve on is pushing for documentation of git repos. While I've discussed this with my managers, and we've concluded that system wide cultural change is hard, I've found that the best thing that I can do is try and help foster incremental improvements and lead by example.
- To do this I am trying to make sure that all of my projects have at minimum have a `README` file that has 1) the purpose of the project in it and 2) has information on how to get the project up and running. Recently during a hackathon that Oracle sponsored, I advised students that this was important, not only for others, but for themselves 6 months from now. I've been bitten in the past from having my own code not be properly documented which can definitely lead to problems.
- I've also tried to add some example projects for myself and others to my `github` - two in particular are a python skeleton git instance and a react example page.

## Think Big

**I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.**
- One of the things that I've done to keep myself sharp and in the game is to go to Hackathons. For me hackathons are putting myself in a room with people who are smarter than myself, and where I will almost always fail. The thing with the fear of failure is that, if you let it, it can be paralyzing. It can mean, especially for a developer, that you become biased to taking the soft and easy path because you know you will "succeed".
- My first hackathon was at the SXSW hackathon of 2017. Remington, a good friend of mine, and I stayed up all night working on a music app that ultimately did not go anywhere. It was a humbling experience. However, I kept at it and persevered, and after many more hackathons we both went to SXSW 2018. He won third place for a audio software that he had gotten patented and I won an award for working on solidity project.
- Awards or no, the point is to fail, and do so a lot.

## Bias for Action

**Do cool stuff**
- I come from a background in finance - having previously worked at the Federal Reserve, Capital One, and having traded my own options. Given that  I had worked on a blockchain project (Oracle Blockchain) I saw an implementation where I could hook a finance api up to pull in up to the minute stock data, and make a "buy/sell" blockchain verification POC.
- This was well received and became one of our flagship POCs for a few months.

## Frugality

**He made this in a cave, from scraps!**
- Usually this is not problem for myself as a developer - if you have a working computer then you have a compiler that should operate on the software that you are given to work on. However, *sometimes* you are put in a position where you must rely on other people's configuration or documentation that is incomplete. So what do you do if something breaks and you don't have the resources to complete the task? You take all the steps you would expect of someone that was trying to convince **you**.
- As a solutions engineer at Oracle, sometimes our projects are bleeding edge releases of what the firm can create. That means that documentation can be incomplete or leg work needs to be put in to get in touch with teams outside of our org. On one such project, which unfortunately I cannot go into too much detail about as it is proprietary, the documentation for the software was incomplete. This required me to get in touch with teams in California, and work with colleagues in another time zone and a different culture to debug work I did not own. Realizing this was a big ask of myself (*and him!*) we treated it as a way to put a feather in our cap rather than a reason the project could not be done.

## Earn Trust
**You are not special. You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.**
- One of the most important things to remember in life is that you wouldn't be here without the help of others. Not only is it ethical to give back to others, but it's a matter of pure survival - people aren't going to be willing to help you if you are not willing to help them. For programmers, it's important to realize that ego can be a problem. We learn how to do things that other people cannot (**literally freakin magic**) but then forget that at one point we didn't know how to do it ourselves.
- But, *right knowledge* isn't enough - this understand must translate into *right action*. One example that comes from work was a project that I was on with a junior employee who wasn't as strong as I in front end creation. It required not only a lot of work from him, but pair programming (personally not a huge fan) and teaching from myself. I got a lot out of it by learning more about what I was teaching and practicing my people skills, and I hope he got a lot of it as well. The project ended up being a success with the client too!

## Dive Deep
**Hey, you mind if I ask a stupid question?**
- The above is a common refrain of mine whenever I am put in a conversation that talks about the project we are working on at a "high level". My feeling is that I don't really care if someone cares if I'm dumb (there's a least a few 100 million people smarter than me and a few 100 million people dumber, so, wanna fight about it?). What I care is that I know what's going on and everyone can get to the same point of understanding. This is a point of communication that is important to me. I'm not sure if I have an anecdote on this point, it's just a thing I do.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

**If someone asks, raise your hand!**
- Sometimes at Oracle we have all hands meetings where we talk about what is going well and what can be improved upon. My philosophy is that if you are above my pay grade I'm not going to *bug* you, but if I'm asked on what can be improved it's my duty as an employee to help out any way I can, checking the ego at the door.
- Being on the sales team, sometimes upper management does not realize the needs of the engineering section under their umbrella. One of the things that we desperately needed was high performance laptops - not because they were shiny toys, but because the cheaper models that were issued as a cost savings measure did not meet the requirements of the job. At an all hands meeting I was the person to raise my hand and say "this is an issue"
- Working with my directors we started documenting all the issues with laptops in an excel spreadsheet and became the squeeky wheel to get this issue fixed. New laptops will be in next week.

## Deliver Results

**Deadlines. 60% of the time, every time.**
- The end of every call that I have with a client is, "so when is this due", just like homework. We can always have a conversation about what is feasible but deadlines are king. `I want it now` is not a useful metric.
- One example of this is when I worked with a third party vendor of Oracle software that didn't know that they could insist on deadlines from my teammate and I. My team mate, who is a bit less experienced than myself was a bit surprised when I insisted on a deadline for the project, a monitoring tool for customers cloud usage. However, the customer and the CEO of the company was pleasantly surprised at our ability to get things done and later ended up adopting React as their front end platform based on our work.
